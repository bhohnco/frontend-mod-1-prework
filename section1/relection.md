## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
> I really liked the article and found it very helpful. I wish I would have seen this article earlier in life, because I believe it would have helped me a ton in high school and college. Either way, I'm glad I saw it now.
I read a lot, and try to go through a book a month. Lately it hasn't been as easy to keep up on, but I'm trying to find time to read more. I eat healthy (for the most part) and try to incorporate a lot of fruit and veggies into my diet.
I need to be better about breaks and not trying to push through work or a project just because I want it done. I find my work slips the more I push myself when I've already been working on something for a few hours. Breaks are very helpful and I plan on doing more of that. Also, trusting the process and keeping in mind that learning is a journey and not a quick fix.
I would add meditation and exercise to the list, but thats all.   

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
**"number"** which describes all numbers including negative, positive, and decimals.
**"string"** which describes text and words, or also numbers and special characters. Almost like a sentence with quotes.
**"boolean"** which describes a yes or no data type, or true or false.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

'''javascript
var greeting ="Hello World!"

console.log(greeting);
'''

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? > ///
What is the purpose of a code comment?
> It allows programmers to add information for other developers in the code in our written spoken language. It also lets you deactivate parts of code you don't want to run or are still working on.  

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
> A marker or placeholder of data that will be used to solve a problem or determine an outcome of an equation.
> I would explain it as almost like Mad-libs, where you have small locations to add words or phrases that will make up the whole outcome of the paragraph/phrase. Adding and changing these words can change adjust the feeling/message/outcome of the paragraph, and that is very similar to variables in coding.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
Instagram
**Array** your news or image feed shows you an array of likes and interests based on pages you follow and your algorithm
**integer** your profile keeps track of how many people you follow and who follows you by providing a number count of each
**boolean** this would be used for do you want to follow this page or when someone follows your page, do you want to follow them back? Yes or no? Also for liking and unliking photos in your app feed
7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
> It reminds me of the welding of two different pieces to make a new project or phrase. The pieces are different in structure and attributes but when they are brought together, they can create something that new and uniformed.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
Instagram
> I think the developers used concatenation when creating some of the background actions you can within the app. For example adding outside links and website to users profiles for shopping or product information. Also having other social media platforms linked to your instagram profile. Being able to share things on instagram that will also be shared on all of your linked social media platforms.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
> I'm still running into some small issues determining the correct attributes, class types, and data types. Does it get a little easier the more you work with these concepts and the more practice you do? I feel comfortable in terminal and GitHub, but struggle a bit with the concepts I listed above. Do you recommend any links, articles, or books to help with this?
