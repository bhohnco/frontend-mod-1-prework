## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
> I feel comfortable asking questions, but lately I need to do a better job of not being shy or apprehensive about asking them. I tend to try to figure it out on my own before asking any questions, but when it comes to coding and learning a new skill, asking questions is really important. Getting out of my shell and not feeling embarrassed about asking a possible question is something I need to work on.
> I feel like I'm somewhere in the middle. I try to ask questions when it feels right and I've taken in as much as I can before needing clarification.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
> In the beginning it was challenging and took some additional searching and reading to get through some parts of the exercises. Honestly, it was hard but rewarding to figure out and helped with learning new information.
> For me the most uncomfortable part came when I ran into a problem, didn't have the answer or example to work off of, and had to not get frustrated, and just figure it out. Taking breaks when I couldn't go any farther, and coming back to the computer after getting some air or going for a walk.
> I think it was beneficial to my learning, and put me more in the driver seat if that makes sense. It gave me the tools, I just needed to figure out the directions to make it all work.


1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
> A conditional statement is a set of rules that are preformed if a certain condition is met.
> For example making coffee. If the coffee maker has water, coffee grounds, and a filter, it can make coffee. But if one of those conditions are not met, the user is unable to make coffee and can't go on.
> I think of entering your username and password for any application you want to open. If you enter the wrong information, the conditions are not met and you can't log in. If they are met, you get to excess your account and profile information within that app or website.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
> To add multiple conditions you would use the "if else" statement in your code. The program reads the "if" statement and if there is an "if else" statement in the code to determine if they are true. If both statements are false the program would go on to the next line of code or "if else" statement. If those came back false as well, the program would move to the last line of code in the block which is usually "else" and that would only run if all of the conditions in the code above it did not evaluate to be true.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
> I have been using https://repl.it/~ to practice and test out conditions before running my code in terminal. It's helpful because you can test out different conditions to see what the outcome will be. It was helpful when trying out the bear code example and the different door situation.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
> I need more practice in setting up the structor of these statements, and making sure I have the correct flow/process. I believe this will become easier to understand with more practice and class work.
