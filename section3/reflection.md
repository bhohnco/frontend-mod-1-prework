## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
> Struggling is part of learning, and the more you realize and understand that, the better off you'll be with coding. Always track your own progress, and don't compare yourself to other peoples work. Keep your eye forward and looking ahead.
> Leaning into struggle and learning to run with that is new to me. The concept is starting to grow on me, and I believe it will help me a ton in the long run.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
> I think I'm a very open minded person and will give most things my best effort. I believe I'm capable of anything I set my mind to. But, I think where I struggle the most is not beating myself up if I don't get something right or don't know the answer to something. That leads to a spiral of "I cant do this" or "I should just give up". But thats the easy thing to do, and I don't want to take the easy route. I want to push through the struggle and get to the other side.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
> Zillow
> The developers use an array when showing homes in my neighborhood and price range. They provide a list of these homes after I run the query and specify what I'm searching for.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
> It helps determine if an object is an array or not. Also, an array method can change an array in many ways. For example by changing the array order, adding to the array, subtracting from the array, or splitting the array.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
> A loop is a useful tool in coding when you want to run a line of code multiple times, but not write out each individual line of code that you want the console to preform. The loop runs until the conditions are met or it hits the end of the array.
> You would use a loop in conjunction with an array if you wanted to send the same message to a group of names, and have the loop go through the array of names until all the messages have been sent. For example sending a happy birthday message to 4 people that have the same birthday. The loop would send all 4 messages instead of the user writing out 4 different lines of code for the same message.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
> A loop is like learning a new trick with a yo-yo. You go through all the steps to perform that new trick until you can successfully do that trick. The loop will run unto you're successful at the new trick, or stop when all the actions have not been met.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
> I would love to see this in real time or in the background of an app? I think I have a decent grasp of both concepts, but I believe seeing it visually and live would help me to understand it in a better way.
