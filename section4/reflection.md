## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
>It felt better with taking breaks and not pushing myself to frustration. I found moment where I wanted to go past the timer and keep working, but that only led to not figuring it out and becoming more frustrated. Break really do help, and taking a longer 20-30 minute break in the middle of your work session really helped. It's very helpful to get away from screens, and go for a walk or read a book. I believe the Pomodoro technique will help me be more productive, and retain more information.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
> I thought it was helpful to write down your tasks and add check marks to them after each break in work. At first it was a little hard to get use to, but I thought it held me more accountable and made me stay on task. I was more focused when I had the timer going, because I could take a break and distract myself with other things when the timer was up. It was almost like work 45 minutes through, and then reward yourself with a break. Having that idea in my head helped me to work diligently for 45 minutes, then stop to recharge.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
> Objects store data, but instead of using only index positions to get the data, you can use strings. An Arry is a list or group of values, where an object stores data and can also contain different data types.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
  > An array because the list does not hold any data, only names.

  * List of states and their capitals
  > An object because each state would have two sets of data and not just one. If it was only state names and not included the capitals it would be an array.

  * List of things to pack for vacation
  > An array because its a list of items that does not hold any data. Only the names of items you need to pack.

  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
  >An object because the list would hold other data items. For example, it usually says how many followers are following that account, number of posts the account has made, and how many other pages the account is following.

  * List of student names and their cohort

  >An object because it would hold two different data types, and string and an integer.

  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake

  >An object because this would hold a few different data types. An array, string, integer, and float depending on the amount of ingredients.

  * All my favorite restaurants

> An array because it would only include the names of the restaurants and not other data types.

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
>Spotify
>keys  artist:
       album:
       genres:
       podcasts:
       length:
>values artistName
        albumName
        genreTypes
        podcastName
        timeLength

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
>None at the moment. This section really helped me to understand them better.
